### 2018-05-13
	Changed: Remember window sizes and positions works a little differently.
	Added: More debug output
### 2018-05-12
	Changed: Explorer crash handling. Should be less convinced about explorer crashes when no such thing happened.
### 2018-05-11
	Changed: CPU sampling is simplified. May run better or worse.
	Changed: Debugging for health monitor low memory functionality.
	Changed: Health monitor memory option now respects the more general paging option.
### 2018-05-09
	Fixed: Network tab packet&error deltas were not functioning.
	Changed: Attempt to color errors in UI log.
### 2018-05-07
	Fixed: Apparently Task.Wait() hangs indefinitely under some obscure circumstances. Caused manual power mode to deadlock?
	Fixed: All CPUs mask was messed up.
	Changed: Power auto-adjust default configuration changed a tiny bit.
### 2018-05-06
	Fixed: Weirdness with full CPU mask affinity. -1 is now special value for ignore in UI instead of 0.
	Changed: Explorer crash handling. It's more informative which process crashed and should handle multiple explorer processes better.
### 2018-05-05
	Changed: Allow watchlist rules with no affinity nor priority.
	Fixed: Empty network device list if it was last active tab.
### 2018-05-04
	Fixed: Validation does not find executables correctly.
	Changed: Some behind the scenes things to help catch an elusive problem with per-app power management.
	Fixed: Resize settings not changed when the rule was edited in UI.
### 2018-04-30
	Changed: Code cleanup.
### 2018-04-29
	Fixed: Clear UI log caused the log to not have anything after.
	Changed: Added a bit more logic to ensure tray becomes visible. May not actually help.
	Added: Option to ignore apps in %SYSTEMROOT%/System32. Enabled by default. Partial implementation.
	Removed: Support for case sensitive matching. Case will now always be ignored.
### 2018-04-28
	Added: Power down monitors when session is locked. Core.ini has two settings for this, one to control user idle timer and second for instant power down.
	Changed: Process adjusts are logged by default again.
	Added: Session lock actions are logged by default.
	Added: Configuration for the above added to Configuration>Logging and added two more debug options.
### 2018-04-25

### 2018-04-24
	Fixed: Default power mode is not applied on start-up if auto-adjust is disabled.
	Removed: Experimental path location feature. Limited usability, documentation, and lack of desire to maintain it made it unwanted.
	Changed: You can now copy multiple lines from the log at the same time to clipboard.
### 2018-04-23
	Fixed: Error at HealthMonitor.cs:380 when foreground monitor was disabled.
	Changed: How empty watchlist is detected.
### 2018-04-22
	Fixed: Retarded WinForms bug.
### 2018-04-18
	Added: Health monitor now warns of low diskspace. Defaults to 150 MB.
	Added: Experimental feature to resize detected apps. Usable as `Resize={Top,Left,Width,Height}` in Watchlist.ini.
	Added: `Remember size=true/false` and `Remember position=true/false` in Watchlist.ini to control the `Resize` option.
	Fixed: Removing a rule did not do proper cleanup, causing rule with similar options to not work correctly without restart.
### 2018-04-17
	Added: Option to disable showing TM in taskbar. Found in Configuration > Behaviour in main window menubar.
### 2018-04-16
	Added: Core.ini option `Immediate configuration saving`, which instead of marking configs for saving on exit, immediately saves them. Disabled by default.
	Changed: Status bar now includes touch count since launch and uses proper labels instead of whatever garbage it was before.
	Fixed: Resizing from window borders now works for main window.
### 2018-04-15
	Added: Extra debug relating to restarting TM.
	Added: Change log started. Older entries are based on scarce notes.
	Fixed: Event log being resized to very small size would hide it behind the above tab element.

	Fixed: Some foreground process debug output.
### 2018-04-12
	Fixed: Unspecified log output fixes.
